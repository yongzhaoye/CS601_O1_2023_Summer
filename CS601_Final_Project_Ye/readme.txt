For the final project, I combined a lot of what I had learned before and fused it into my personal website.

Include: 
Mouse hover to change pictures: This is achieved using JavaScript event listeners which listen for the 'mouseover' event and change the image source accordingly.
Show/Hide content: JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of certain elements on the page. This provides an interactive way for users to explore content.
Buttons to change the image: We have used JavaScript to listen for button click events, and change the displayed image based on the button clicked.

The common styles include font styles, background colors, padding, margins, image styling, list styling, and footer styling.

Difficulties Faced:
One of the challenges was ensuring the images displayed maintain a consistent size despite having different original sizes. This was achieved using CSS's `object-fit` property, which allows the images to cover the full area of the element, cropping where necessary.
Another difficulty was managing the JavaScript code to keep it organized and easy to understand. We tackled this by using well-named variables and functions, and adding comments to explain what each part of the code does.

Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements could include adding more interactivity, perhaps with more advanced JavaScript or using a framework like Vue.js or React. This could provide a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
