My start page is called "homePage.html", and other two pages are about my hobbies and my hometown.
For the week two content, I have an external CSS file named "styles.css" that is linked to each HTML file. The CSS file contains styles for common elements across all pages, as well as media queries for different screen sizes.
The common styles include font styles, background colors, padding, margins, image styling, list styling, and footer styling.
The media queries in the CSS file target different screen sizes. For example, at smaller screen sizes, the header font size is reduced, and the image width is set to a maximum of 100%. At medium screen sizes, the header padding is reduced, the h1 font size is increased, and the image width is set to a maximum of 80%. At larger screen sizes, the main section is displayed in a grid layout with two columns.
In addition to these basic layout designs, I also design frames and color fills for each part of the page to make it more designed. Especially for the menu bar, I designed to highlight the color of the selected button and make the darker color stay on the selected page. And for the footer bar, I used "position: sticky" to fix the footer bar at the bottom of the screen.
