                    <p>Since I was in college, I was exposed to the game League of Legends because of my roommate. 
                        After playing for a while, I fell in love with this game of teamwork and competition. </p>
                    <p>This game usually requires five teammates to develop the character they choose at the same time,
                         and then win by grabbing some public resources to push down the opponent's base.
                         I have also gained friendship and interest from this game. Although I can't play for a long time
                         due to busy learning tasks, the tens of minutes of game time in my spare time can still make me feel relaxed and happy.</p>
                    <p>I have provided the official website of League of Legends below, interested friends can go to learn about it!</p>

                    <p>Skiing is also a sport I have been exposed to since college. Compared with online games,
                         skiing brings me completely different stimulation. I really enjoy the process of sliding down from a high place,
                          and I feel like flying in the process.</p>
                    <p>After coming to Boston, I have been to three nearby ski resorts many times.
                        I made a table to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the three ski resorts based on my personal feelings.
                        I hope it can be helpful to friends who like skiing.</p>
