For this week's assgnment demonstrates form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes client-side validation to ensure the entered data meets specific requirements before submitting the form.

For HTML5 Form Controls: The form is created using HTML5 form controls such as text input fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes. Required attribute is used to enforce mandatory fields.

CSS Styling: The page is styled using an external CSS stylesheet. Various CSS properties are applied to enhance the visual appearance of the form.

Client-Side Validation: JavaScript is used for client-side validation to ensure that the entered data meets specific criteria before submitting the form. The validation rules include minimum length, character restrictions, and predefined values.

Event Handling: JavaScript event handlers are utilized to trigger validation functions when the form is submitted. The form submission is prevented if any validation errors are found.

Difficult Areas:

1. Aligning Labels and Inputs: To align the labels and inputs correctly, flexbox is used. The `display: flex` property is applied to the container element, and the necessary flexbox properties are used to control the alignment and spacing of the elements.

2. Symmetrical Alignment of Options: To achieve symmetrical alignment of options, the `display: flex` property is applied to the container element. The `align-items` property is set to `baseline` to align the options vertically, and appropriate margin and padding values are applied to achieve the desired spacing.

3. Validation Logic: JavaScript is used to perform client-side validation. Validation functions are created to check the entered data against the defined criteria. Regular expressions and string manipulation methods are utilized to validate input patterns and lengths.
